%\subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces}
{\color{Blue}\subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces}}
In order to work well and give the possibility to take advantage of the services offered by the system, both Data4Help and AuomatedSOS are required to be installed in a smartphone that provides:
\begin{itemize}
	\item GPS system
	\item Bluetooth (or BLE) interface
\end{itemize} 
The first requirement is needed especially for ASOS users, as substitute of GPS bracelets or similar, in order to provide the position of the user each time the system asks for it.\par
The second requirement is important because most of the available sensor devices on the market can be connected to the smartphone using Bluetooth or BLE interfaces.\par
Sensor devices are not mandatory but strongly suggested to allow D4H to acquire health parameters (like blood pressure, HR, breath rate and so on), without them, the application does not provide consistent advantages to the users. 
\paragraph{}


%\subsubsection{Software Interfaces}
{\color{Blue}\subsubsection{Software Interfaces}}
D4H and ASOS rely only on Google Maps API as external service. Both the computation and the storage part of the system are completely hosted and managed by TrackMe. Depending on more external services can affect negatively the reliability of the system. \par
\paragraph{}


%\subsubsection{Communication Interfaces}
{\color{Blue}\subsubsection{Communication Interfaces}}
In order to ensure confidentiality, data integrity and server authenticity, HTTPS is likely to be used as network protocol to manage the encrypted communication between the client (user or third party) and TrackMe servers for security reasons. Since the protocol uses TCP at transport layer is probable to deal with problems related to delays in communication. A deep analysis of how much acceptable are such delays must be carried out.

%\subsubsection{Scenario 1}
{\color{Blue}\subsubsection{Scenario 1}}

Ross is a Dr. Herbert's patient, he discovers that he is registered to Data4Help, the new service provided by TrackMe and decides to subscribe to it in order to facilitate the doctor to access his own health indicators. Ross so, downloads the app on his smartphone, runs it and fullfils the form for the registration. The system asks Ross the permission to collect data from all the devices the user will register in the system. Once this procedure is completed, the service detects that a compatible smartwatch and a respiratory rate monitoring device are connected to the mobile phone through the bluetooth interface. Then, the application asks Ross which one he wants to register to the service. Ross selects them and allow the system to complete the operation. The app, once finished, signals to the user that it is ready to notify possible requests from third parties to access the monitored information.
During the evening, Dr. Herbert receives the message from Ross who confirms his registration to Data4Help. The doctor logs in the service using the hospital credencials and inserts "Ross Gilbert" in the search form. Dr. Herbert then, once the system found the user's account, formulates the request including the motivation and sends it to Data4Help. Ross, the morning after, runs the application that notifies him of the awaiting request, so he checks for the requestor and accepts it.

{\color{Blue}\subsubsection{Scenario 2}}

Angelo has bought two smart devices, an elastic strip equipped with a sensor able to measure blood pressure and an electronic bracelet for monitoring HR. He discovers that they can be interfaced with his smartphone through Bluetooth interface, so requests to the application to register the device, the service starts to check if the detected sensors are compatible or not. Unfortunately, only one of them is completely supported by the system: the sensor strip. So Angelo accepts to register only one device and the app, once performed the operation, update its status and return to collect data from all the connected devices.

%\subsubsection{Scenario 3}
{\color{Blue}\subsubsection{Scenario 3}}

SoftGalaxy is a software company that is working on a new application to provide to registered users a modern service called Health Advisor. It can suggest changes in daily habits, in diet and more, according to user data provided to the system. Unfortunately, the company cannot afford a large-scale system to collect information in real-time. In order to save as much resources as possible, it decides to rely on Data4Help to achieve this task. Before releasing the application, SoftGalaxy connects to the system and registers itself as third party, fulfilling the proper form. In addition, Data4Help asks the company to provide its digital certification for security reasons. Once the procedure is completed, the organization confirms the registration through the company's email address.

{\color{Blue}\subsubsection{Scenario 4}}
The company Virgin Active is considering opening a new gym near Saint Ambrogio church in Milan. In order to do so, it decides to ask to Track Me to receive the information about all the overweight people that live in the area of Saint Ambrogio. TrackMe replied with a negative answer because there are only 593 people that suits with the requirements. Virgin Active has to change the request and so asks the same information but for a larger area taking in also the area of Saint Agostino. This time there are enough people to let the request being forwarded and so Virgin Active can receive the information needed.

Michelle has an elderly mother, Teresa, who suffers about a rare heart disease. She is constantly monitored by a portable ECG device due to the high risk of being hit by an heart attack. Unfortunately, Michelle works during the morning and in this period of the day no one takes care of Teresa. She suggests to the mother to rely on AutomatedSOS, a Data4Help-based service. Since the elderly woman has a smartphone, with Data4Help installed and a personal account, she decides to download the application and logs in with Data4Help credencials. The system notices that Teresa is using the service for the first time, so it asks some information about her health problems and through it the app creates an health profile and a list of required sensors. The ECG that is actually monitoring her, is already registered and used by Data4Help, but since she has specified that suffers about loss of consciousness the system warns her that a fall sensor should be registered to provide the proper assistance. Teresa has not the device yet, so ignores the warning and complete the profiling procedure. The app finally, is ready to monitor the womanâ€™s health status.

%\subsection {Performance Requirements}
{\color{Blue}\subsection{Performance Requirements}}

Both Data4Help and AutomatedSOS aim to help the highest number of people. AutomatedSOS must guarantee that the user's information is sent in real time to the application so the emergency can be solved as soon as possible. A delay higher than 3 seconds canâ€™t be tolerated. Data4Help have to make avaiable the information of each user during an entire month.
\paragraph{}


%\subsection{Design Constraints}
{\color{Blue}\subsection{Design Constraints}}

%\subsection{Software System Attributes}
{\color{Blue}\subsection{Software System Attributes}}
%\subsubsection{Reliability}
{\color{Blue}\subsubsection{Reliability}}
Data4Help presents a critical factor related to the data processing on server side. As already motivated, this huge amount of information related to each connected user should be processed in real-time especially when supporting AutomatedSOS users, any failure of both the services could potentially lead to the death of a person. A domino effect, in which a generic fail may cause the blackout of the entire service is unacceptable and must be avoided.
\paragraph{}

%\subsubsection{Availability}
{\color{Blue}\subsubsection{Availability}}
The software has to be online 24/7, in particular the AutomatedSOS part because its chore is to guarantee a constant control of the users. In this case the system should be kept down for the least time possible when performing maintenance. For minimizing the risk of having interruption of service for patients who need assistance, an availability of at least 99.999\% has to be granted. It is an exigent but required value. Since AutomatedSOS relies on Data4Help for collecting data, both the services should have the same availability. Unfortunately this requirement is too expensive for all the users of D4H. It is sufficient to provide such level of availability only for all the users who rely on AutomatedSOS and a value of 99.99\% for the remaining ones. This solution can reduce appreciably the costs of maintenance.
\paragraph{}

%\subsubsection{Security}
{\color{Blue}\subsubsection{Security}}
Companies and organizations that want to rely on the service must certificate their identity. For the first version of the application, a third party has to provide to the service a valid digital certification, released by a well-known and reliable Certification Authority. This represent an essential security requirement that also provide a strong encrypted communication between the third party and TrackMe. Since TrackMe is also provided with a digital certification, user data sent to the server are encrypted using TLS (Transport Layer Security). \par
Passwords of both users and third parties, must be hashed and salted on server side.
\paragraph{}

%\subsubsection{Maintainability}
{\color{Blue}\subsubsection{Maintainability}}

Especially for Data4Help, the system will deal with an enormous amount of data coming from a wide variety of sensors. Maintainability challenges will concern mainly with the support of new sensor devices appearing in the market that must be supported by the system. The architecture should facilitate the introduction of new products to speed up updated versions of the system.
\paragraph{}

%\subsubsection{Portability}
{\color{Blue}\subsubsection{Portability}}

The application have to be developed in order to support all the Android devices with an API level higher or equal to 15 (Android 4.0, Ice Cream Sandwich).
